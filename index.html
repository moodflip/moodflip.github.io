		<h2>PROBLEMS IDENTIFIED</h2>

		<p>
			<span class="coloredtext">Menstruation</span> cramps are the result of contractions of the uterus, causing aches, pain, and throbbing, in the lower abdomen.
The term dysmenorrhoea refers to painful <span class="coloredtext">Menstruation</span>.
It is a cramp labour-like pain in the lower abdomen that radiates to the upper abdomen, waist and thighs and sometimes results in vomiting, headache, etc. In dealing with this, medications such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and contraception pills are used irregularly because of fear of their side effects. These cramps are often treated with (OTC) pain relieves like Tylenol (acetaminophen), Advil (ibuprofen), or Aleve (naproxen). And these all medications are harmful and have side effects of their own.<br><br>

	<div id="history">
		<h2>FROM WHERE WE STARTED</h2>
		<p>Aayushi thought to make chocolates at home and sell it as homemade chocolate. She named it Darkies!
It was decided to just make normal chocolate cause it was just her hobby nothing more than that...After 2-4 days while returning from college one of our friends
wanted chocolates cause she was on her periods and craving them.. so suddenly an idea kicked into Vanshaj's mind, that why not to make it herbal chocolate  
which will give relief to women/girls in their period cramps. Cramps sometimes match the frequency of a heart attack. The pain occurs because of the
contraction in the lower abdomen, and to get relief girls take heavy dose medicines that have their side effects and are not good for a female body.
By picking this idea we went to the pharmacy department added and searched about how we could make it with herbs. 
And finally, after 12-14 tries, we got our composition AVA3 ready and we invented "mood flip chocolates". Also tried it on girls of our college, and guess what it worked!!
Presented this idea in competition and got the first position and cash price of Rs 51000 among the 97 business ideas all across the country
so that's how our story begins..and to be continued.</p>
